# Iris
I developed an Iris Flower Classification project using the Python Colaboratory framework during my internship at Oasis Infobyte in the field of data science. Over the course of the internship, I successfully completed three tasks, with the first task being:

*Task 1: Iris Flower Classification*

In this task, I focused on classifying Iris Flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their measurements, specifically the sepal and petal length and width. To achieve this, I employed Python and leveraged machine learning algorithms to train a model for classification. The project utilized essential libraries available in Google Colaboratory, including:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn
4. Matplotlib

This comprehensive project allowed me to build a model that can accurately identify the Iris flower species based on their characteristics.
